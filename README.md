# Raytracer
A raytracer written in C++ from scratch with capabilities of polygon meshes and other interesting geometry

Done as part of a Parallel Computing class during my junior year in High School.

Uploaded a few years after the termination of the class for record-keeping purposes.

Feel free to let me know about any bugs / etc, though it is unlikely that this will be continued further
